INSTRUCTIONS:

Hello welcome to group 9’s README on our term project! All collaborations were originally done through SFU's gitlabs so this just displays our end product. 
Running our game is quite simple and I hope you enjoy it.

To run the game I suggest you follow these steps.

1. mvn clean
2. mvn compile
3. mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.mycompany.app.Game"

And that is all that is required! Every thing should run smooth and straight forward from there. Enjoy!

To run the tests on our game it’s also quite simple!

1. mvn clean
2. mvn compile
3. mvn test

To generate javadocs

1. mvn clean
2. mvn site javadoc:javadoc

and that is that!

Thank you for taking your time to review our project!!
